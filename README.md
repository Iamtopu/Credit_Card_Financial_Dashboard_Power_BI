- Promote online transactions by encouraging customers to use their cards for online purchases through incentives like bonus points or exclusive discounts for online transactions.
- Expand customer base to the potential age group between 30 - 40 as it generates less revenue than the 40 - 60 age group. Tailoring specific products and marketing campaigns to attract this segment such as lower fee cards or exclusive deals.
- Diversify spending across categories and attract customers with category-specific promotions (e.g., fuel discounts or grocery cashback) to encourage spending in other areas like travel or food.
